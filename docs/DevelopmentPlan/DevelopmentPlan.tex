\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

This project will have a machine learning aspect, along with a user interface or dashboard, and a data processing pipeline. The technologies below were selected initially, however, there will be changes as the project progresses due to stakeholder constraints and future design choices.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

someone not contributing their fair share?}

instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
