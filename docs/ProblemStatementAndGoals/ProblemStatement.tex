\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Extras}

The group will develop a user instructional video and a user manual as supplementary extra materials.  These extra resources will provide comprehensive support to farmers, ensuring they can effectively operate the proposed system to monitor their cow livestock. As farmers are typically middle aged, there may be a learning gap with technology. It is important that our primary stakeholders are supported and the tool is easily usable by them. Approval of the extras will be confirmed with the project supervisor.
