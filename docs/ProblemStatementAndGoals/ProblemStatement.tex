\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Dairy and cattle farmers are responsible for the health and wellness of thousands of cows. The condition of the livestock in their care directly influences profit margins and productivity of the farm as a whole. Monitoring health conditions and behaviour must be done to minimize consequences of illness and injury, but the process is labour intensive and time consuming, making it difficult to track animal health, infections, weight, and productivity effectively. Not only do any minuscule changes need to be noticed within dozens of cows, the cows then need to be identified often by the farmer walking through the pen to check an ear tag. The length and complexity of the process make monitoring cow wellness incredibly difficult. The project aims to provide a solution that simplifies the monitoring process and provides an early indication of health issues, improving animal welfare and therefore farm productivity. \\ 

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: Video feed showing cows where they live at a farm. Setting to be determined.
    \item Output: User readable data reporting cow attributes and/or behaviour. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
