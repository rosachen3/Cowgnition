\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{Direct Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Farmers:} They are the primary users of this software as this project aims to improve the efficiency of their workflows.
    \item \textbf{Luke Schuurman (Supervisor and CATTLEytics Inc. Representative):} Luke has a vested interest in the development of this project. He will
    play a crucial role directing our team throughout the project. He will be the main point of contact to garner a shared understanding of the vision CATTLEytics Inc. has
    for this project, and as such he will provide us with the necessary resources, including video data, to ensure the success of this project.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Indirect Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Food and Agriculture Regulatory Bodies:} They establish rules on animal welfare, food safety and traceability that influence the design and operation of our product.
    \item \textbf{Dairy and Meat Processing Companies, QA Division:} They rely on farms to provide the necessary raw materials that are compliant with safety standards.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Environment}
\subsubsection{Software Environment}
Software required for this system to work as expected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cloud-based environment to train model (Google Colab, AWS etc.)
    \item Web-based environment to show alerts and results
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware Environment}
Hardware required for this system to work as expected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High-resolution IP or Smart IoT-based camera systems with edge compute devices installed in the farm
    \item Devices for farmers to access any real-time alerts or results of the model
    \item On-premise server to archive videos
\end{itemize}
\textbf{NOTE:} This will be provided and installed by CATTLEytics. Inc in the farms. This is the infrastructure that the system will use to operate.


\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}
